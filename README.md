# Comparing_Malware_Detection_in_Application_Dataset

<h1>Comparing Malware Detection in Application Software</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This project compares the performance of different machine learning algorithms for malware detection in application software, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).</p>

<h3>Code</h3>

<p>The main script is available in malware_detection.py</p>

<h3>Dataset</h3>

<p>The dataset used is stored in malware_dataset.csv.</p>

<h3>Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>

<h4>Decision Trees</h4>
<p>Decision Trees are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each step.</p>

<h4>Random Forest</h4>
<p>Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple Decision Trees during training and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction. It improves accuracy and control over-fitting.</p>

<h4>Logistic Regression</h4>
<p>Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification. It predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. Despite its name, it is used for classification tasks rather than regression.</p>

<h4>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h4>
Support Vector Machine is a versatile machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates classes in the feature space. In this project, a linear kernel is employed for classification.
